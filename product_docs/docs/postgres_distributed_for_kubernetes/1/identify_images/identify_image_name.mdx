title: 'Identifying your image names'
---

For a quick installation with the aim of testing the product, see the [Quickstart](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/quickstart/). 
For more targeted testing or production purposes, 
the following section provides an overview of how to select a specific operand and proxy image version that goes in line with your Postgres distribution.

## Operand image name 

See [Operand images](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/private_registries/#operand-images) for general information about the images.  

### Name elements 

The operand image name is composed of three elements: the postgres type, EDB Postgres Distributed, and the build version.

**The Postgres type:** The first step towards identifying your image names is knowing which Postgres type you are going to use, and how it translates to an image name. 

| Postgres type                | Image name            |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | edb-postgres-advanced |
| EDB Postgres Extended Server | edb-postgres-extended |
| PostgreSQL                   | postgresql            |

**EDB Postgres Distributed:** The next step is identifying how Postgres Distributed translates to an image name. This is the same for all environment configurations: 

| Product name             | Image name |
|--------------------------|------------|
| EDB Postgres Distributed | pgd        |

**Build version:** Last, the build version is 1, unless a new image is created in the scope of a security patch.

### Assembling the operand image name 

These identifiers, together with their versions, translate to an operand image name. Here are a few examples: 

| Postgres + version         | EDB Postgres Distributed + version | Build | Operand image name                       |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| EDB Postgres Advanced 16.2 | PGD 5.4.1                          | 1     | edb-postgres-advanced-pgd:16.2.0-5.4.1-1 |
| EDB Postgres Extended 15.6 | PGD 5.4.0                          | 1     | edb-postgres-extended-pgd:15.6-5.4.0-1   |
| PostgreSQL 16.2            | PGD 5.4.1                          | 1     | postgresql-pgd:16.2-5.4.1-1              |

For an overview of Postgres compatibility, see [Platform compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility).

!!! Note Postgres version format
    For PostgreSQL and EDB Extended Server images, the Postgres version is provided in `x.y` format, for example, 15.6. For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the Postgres version is provided in `x.y.z` format, for example, 15.6.2.

## Proxy image name 

The proxy image name and version derive from EDB Postgres Distributed. See the [EDB Postgres Distributed release notes](/pgd/latest/rel_notes/) for an overview of PGD versions and corresponding PGD proxy versions. For example: 

| Proxy version   | Proxy image name    |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| PGD Proxy 5.4.0 | edb-pgd-proxy:5.4.0 |
